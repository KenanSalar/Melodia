//! Daily auto-check loop.
//!
//! Cadence:
//!
//! - **30 s after launch**: one-shot first check (gives the runtime time
//!   to settle and avoids racing the launch folder scan for
//!   network I/O).
//! - **Then every 6 h**: re-arm via `tokio::time::sleep`. Not
//!   `tokio::time::interval` — `interval` fires every tick instantly
//!   after a laptop wake from sleep, which would burst-check.
//! - **The auto-check switch is read per tick**, not at the spawn — the
//!   welcome card and Settings ▸ Updates both offer it mid-session, and a
//!   boot-time decision leaves either describing a task the user can no
//!   longer start or stop. Toggling it also cuts the sleep short
//!   (`AppState::auto_check_changed`), or the answer would land whenever
//!   the loop next happened to wake.
//! - **24 h elapsed gate** inside each tick reads
//!   `settings.updates.last_check_unix`; if less than a day has passed
//!   the tick logs "skipped" and re-sleeps. Lets the loop survive a
//!   suspend/resume mid-cycle without spurious double-checks.
//! - **Failure backoff**: repeated failures lengthen the cadence along
//!   [`BACKOFF_LADDER`], which argues its own steps, and the next
//!   successful check resets it. Mitigates flaky-network / firewall
//!   thrash that would otherwise re-fire every 6 h.
//!
//! Each iteration that passes those gates is [`run_check`], the same check
//! the Settings button runs, framed by the panel's checking state. A failure
//! is logged and nothing more: a background check stays quiet.
