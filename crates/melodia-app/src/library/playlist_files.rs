//! Playlist import/export to Extended-M3U8 files.
//!
//! Lets a user back up playlists to portable `.m3u8` files so they survive a
//! database wipe (OS reinstall), and import them back into a fresh library.
//! One playlist exports as a bare `.m3u8`; several as one zip holding a
//! `.m3u8` per playlist, which import reads back whole. Never several in one
//! `.m3u8`: the format carries one `#PLAYLIST:` per file, so every other player
//! and our own parser would read them as one merged list. Interoperates with
//! other players: our writer emits standard Extended-M3U8 plus a
//! `#MELODIA-HASH` extension, and our parser tolerantly reads foreign M3U/M3U8
//! files.
//!
//! Import is **skip-and-report**: each entry is re-matched to a library track
//! by exact `file_path`, then by BLAKE3 `file_hash`; anything unmatched is
//! counted as *missing* (the user is expected to have re-scanned their music
//! first). Pure format handling lives in [`m3u`], the zip in [`archive`].
