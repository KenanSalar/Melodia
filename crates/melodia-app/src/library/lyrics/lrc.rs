//! The LRC format, pure and IO-free.
//!
//! Hand-rolled rather than a crate, for `playlist_files::m3u`'s reason: the format is small and
//! settled, so a dependency would be carried forever against a parser that never needs to change.
//!
//! [`parse`] is total and tolerant. It takes a sidecar file, a lyrics tag or an API field without
//! being told which, and answers with a timed sheet, a plain one, or nothing. So no caller has to
//! ask whether some text "is LRC" before handing it over, and whether the answer came back timed
//! is [`Lyrics::is_synced`]'s question rather than a second one asked up front.
