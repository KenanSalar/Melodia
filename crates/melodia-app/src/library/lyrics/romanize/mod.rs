//! The sung words in Latin letters, for a reader who cannot sound out the script they are in.
//!
//! **Three engines, and which one answers is decided per run rather than per crate.** `uroman`
//! reads about a hundred scripts and is the general case. The two exceptions are the two scripts
//! this feature exists for, and both were measured against the spelling the lyric sites publish
//! before being written:
//!
//! - **Hangul is ours**, because uroman spells ㅊ `c` and the tense consonants `gg`/`dd`/`bb`, so
//!   꽃 came back `ggoc` against Revised Romanization's `kkot`. Ten of eighteen common words were
//!   wrong. RR is arithmetic on the syllable block and needs no dictionary, so there is nothing to
//!   trade for it.
//! - **Japanese is `kakasi`**, because uroman carries no Japanese readings at all and romanizes
//!   kanji as Mandarin: 世界 comes back `shijie` where the sheet wants `sekai`. Kana is the only
//!   thing that tells kanji from hanzi, and a line can carry none while its sheet does, which is
//!   why [`apply`] takes the whole sheet and settles the question once for all of it.
//!
//! **A Latin sheet costs one `is_ascii` pass and no engine call.** The rest runs inside the
//! resolver's `spawn_blocking`, once per track change, so nothing here is on the UI thread. What
//! it produces is stored per line and filtered at draw time, which is what makes the toggle
//! instant.
