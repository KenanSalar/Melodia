//! The device under the decks: reopening it, following each track's format into it, and taking
//! it exclusively.
//!
//! **A reopen is decided at the track boundary, from the decoder, before the track is heard.**
//! It happens under the decks lock, ahead of the append that starts the track, so nothing of it
//! plays in the old format. That is also why a crossfade and a reopen cannot share a transition,
//! and why a gapless stage refuses a track that needs one: both would need the outgoing track
//! still playing across it. So each asks of the next track whether the stream open now plays it,
//! and one that needs a reopen starts at `EndOfStream` instead.
//!
//! **An exclusive claim is held through a pause and given back on stop**, so a stopped player
//! never keeps other applications off the card. Where the user asks for it, a long pause ends in
//! that stop too, the track left on screen paused.
