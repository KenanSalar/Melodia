//! `RecentlyPlayed.*` callbacks, split by concern:
//!
//! * [`covers`] — the Most Played grid's lazy cover-lookup callback.
//! * [`subviews`] — the Most Played card actions, the tab switch, and the
//!   grid's column-count push.
//! * [`tracklist`] — the Songs tab: row actions, filter, column visibility,
//!   modifier-aware selection, and its Shuffle pill.
//! * [`lifecycle`] — section enter/leave cache management + the joined
//!   `library_changed` + `stats_changed` re-fetch subscriber.
