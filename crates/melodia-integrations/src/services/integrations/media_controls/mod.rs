//! OS media controls: MPRIS on Linux, SMTC on Windows, `MediaPlayer` on macOS.

//! `cfg`-split, with this module the shared façade. Linux serves MPRIS itself rather than through

//! on a timer, and every push re-announces `PlaybackStatus`, which KDE Connect forwards to each
//! paired phone as a packet.
