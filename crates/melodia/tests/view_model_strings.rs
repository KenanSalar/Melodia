//! The values that cross into Slint as **free strings**, and the `.slint` literals that branch
//! on them.
//!
//! Two of them: `RepeatMode` and `PlaybackStatus` reach `PlayerViewModel` through
//! `ui::shell::bridge` as whatever `as_str` returns. Nothing on either side is checked by a
//! compiler, and neither failure is loud: a renamed `RepeatMode::Off` leaves the repeat button lit
//! in every state, because the sheet asks `!= "off"`.
//!
//! Here rather than beside either tree, and this is the case `CLAUDE.md` draws the line for: the
//! claim is about two trees at once, so neither the enum's own suite nor a `.slint` pin can hold
//! it. The enums' Rust halves stay where they are, in `engine/tests/types_tests.rs`.
//!
//! The direction is deliberate. **Every literal the sheet compares against must be one the enum
//! can produce**, not the reverse: `RepeatMode::All` is legitimately never named in a comparison,
//! the sheet distinguishing only "one" from "not off". A rename on *either* side still fails it,
//! since renaming the Rust variant is what makes the sheet's literal unproducible.
