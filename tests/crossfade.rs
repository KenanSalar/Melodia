//! End-to-end crossfade check against the real audio chain, no audio device.
//!
//! `output::mixer::pair` builds the two halves with no device between them, so two real decks can
//! be driven and the summed output pulled by hand — exercising the Symphonia decoder, `EqSource`'s
//! fade stage, the visualizer tap, the rate converter and the unclamped sum for real.
//!
//! The fixtures are constant-amplitude DC WAVs, because two perfectly correlated
//! signals under a complementary *linear* crossfade sum to a constant: the mixed
//! output must hold steady at the source amplitude across the whole overlap and
//! never exceed it, which is exactly what keeps the unclamped mixer from
//! clipping.
//!
//! ⚠ Pulling the mixer *is* the audio thread here, and `clear` and `try_seek` block until that
//! thread services them, so a control op that makes one must run on a separate thread while this
//! one keeps pulling. See [`drive_until`].
