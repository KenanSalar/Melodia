//! Panic reports, written beside the rolling log.
//!
//! `panic = "abort"` in release means every Rust panic anywhere in the process
//! is fatal, so a hook is complete coverage of the Rust half rather than a
//! partial measure — and it does run under abort: the pinned toolchain's
//! `rust_panic_with_hook` dispatches the hook before `__rust_start_panic`. It
//! also means a run produces at most one report, since the first panic ends the
//! process.
//!
//! **On what a backtrace is worth here.** `[profile.release]` sets
//! `strip = "debuginfo"` rather than `strip = true` precisely so these stay
//! readable, but that keeps the symbol table and not the line table — frames
//! carry function names and no `file:line` — and `lto = "fat"` plus
//! `codegen-units = 1` inline hard enough that the trace is sparse. v0 mangling
//! at least makes the names unambiguous across monomorphizations. The `log`
//! macros' own `file:line` in the rolling log is what fills the gap, which is
//! why `services::logging` formats files with `detailed_format`.
//!
//! Timestamps are **local**, unlike everything else persisted by this app
//! (`utils::now_rfc3339` is UTC). These reports sit in one folder with the log
//! files and get read together, `flexi_logger` stamps its lines in local time,
//! and a reporter saying "it crashed around 2pm" should match the filename. The
//! RFC-3339 offset keeps it unambiguous.
