//! The hand-over bundle: one text file a reporter attaches to an issue.
//!
//! Everything here is chosen twice — once for being useful in a bug report,
//! once for being safe to publish. **The settings block is an allowlist, never
//! a whole-struct dump**, so a field added to `SettingsData` cannot silently
//! start shipping; `scrobble_credentials.json` is not read by this module at
//! all, at any point.
//!
//! **The log tail rides on a property worth keeping**: no `log::` call site in
//! this tree interpolates a token, session key or password. Anything added that
//! does breaks this file's safety without touching it, so log the fact that a
//! request was signed rather than what signed it.
//!
//! Every path goes through [`redact_home`], since a home directory usually
//! holds a real name.
