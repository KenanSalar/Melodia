/// fires `active-changed` on a real *transition*. Its `ChangeTracker` is
/// evaluated inside `AppWindow::new()` and adopts that first value **silently**
/// — `ChangeTracker::init` assigns it and never calls the notify half
/// (`init_delayed` is the variant that would, and the generated tree uses it
/// nowhere) — so the boot reading never reaches Rust and becomes the baseline
/// every later evaluation is compared against.
///
/// Hydrate afterwards and every seed answers for the global's declared default
/// (`3`, Tracks), leaving `TracksUi` marked active for a section that isn't on
/// screen: the gate's baseline is already `false`, so it has no `false` edge
