//! Radio library API, and the only door the UI has onto stations.
//!
//! Thin wrappers over `queries::radio` today. Phase 2's radio-browser.info
//! searches land in this same module rather than beside it, so a callback never
//! has to know whether the local table or the network answered, and so the
//! toggle that turns radio off has one place to guard.
//!
//! Writes here deliberately do not bump `library_changed_tx`. Its subscribers
//! are the library views, none of which shows a station; the Radio section
//! refreshes through its own global.
